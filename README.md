# The Cockroach
The "Cockroach" is the colloquial name for our first vehicle. It was built over the summer of 2015 by DriveAI. Below is a breakdown of the various aspects of its design.

#Hardware
- The Cockroach began as a [ScooterX Baja 49cc Go-Kart](http://www.scooterx.biz/en/gas-go-karts/20-49cc-scooterx-baja-off-road-go-kart.html). 
- The frame has been heavily modified. We removed the seat and bolted a sheet of particle board to the frame in its place to house all of the electronics. A custom metal body was bolted to the existing frame to give a more car-like appearance and protect the internals. 
- A custom [3D-printed gas gas cable actuator housing](https://github.com/DriveAI/cockroach-actuator/tree/master/parts) was designed, and uses a standard size servo motor to control acceleration.
- Steering and braking were actuated using [Firgelli Automations linear actuators](https://www.firgelliauto.com/products/feedback-rod-actuator) bolted directly to the steering column and brake cable, respectively.
